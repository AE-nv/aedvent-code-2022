# AE Advent of Code, 2022 edition

This repository contains code submissions by AE employees for Advent of Code 2022 http://adventofcode.com/2022

Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme. Read more [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).
